- Server is a GUI - functions to control visualization
- ViewVisualization - functions to wrap data for GUI


###  Data structure:
- results/hour_1/
      - nodes       -> node_id, node_type, demand [MW]
      - gens         -> node_id, generation [MW], cost [zÅ‚]
      - branches  -> node_from, node_to, flow [MW]
- results/hour_2/
- 
- ...
- 
- results/hour_24/
