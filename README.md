# energy_network_visualization

It's visualization task of energy network flow. Data are stored in task_data.hdf5 file. There are 24 folders for each hour in day.

Solution was based on MVC design pattern. 

Each class contains:
- DataLoader - functions to load data
- Server is a GUI - functions to control visualization
- ViewVisualization - functions to wrap data for GUI


###  Data structure:
- results/hour_1/
     - nodes       -> node_id, node_type, demand [MW]
     - gens         -> node_id, generation [MW], cost [zÅ‚]
     - branches  -> node_from, node_to, flow [MW]
- results/hour_2/
- ...
- results/hour_24/

### Implemented functionality
- differences in the flows on the edges (arrows on edges)
- differences in the operation of nodes (the node gets power from others, the node generates power for others) 
     - Black node (gets power from others
     - Green node (generates power)
     - Orange node (consume more power than is generating)
-
